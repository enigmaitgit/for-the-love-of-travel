# Stretching Fix Summary

## Issue
The first two post cards in the featured posts section were appearing stretched, likely due to the large width (624px) and specific height (240px) dimensions.

## Root Cause
The stretching was caused by several factors:
1. **minHeight constraint**: The VideoAwarePostCard was using `minHeight` which could cause stretching
2. **Aspect ratio issues**: Very wide cards (624px) with relatively short height (240px) could cause media stretching
3. **Text stretching**: Text content was stretching across the full width of very wide cards

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Height Constraints
**Before**:
```javascript
minHeight: width === '100%' ? '200px' : '240px'
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Remove minHeight to prevent stretching, use fixed height instead
maxHeight: height || '180px'
```

### 2. Improved Media Aspect Ratio
**Added to video element**:
```javascript
style={{
  width: '100%',
  height: '100%',
  objectFit: 'cover',
  objectPosition: 'center',
  // Ensure video maintains aspect ratio and doesn't stretch
  minHeight: '100%',
  minWidth: '100%'
}}
```

**Added to image element**:
```javascript
style={{
  display: isVideoPost && isValidVideoUrl ? 'none' : 'block',
  objectFit: 'cover',
  objectPosition: 'center'
}}
```

### 3. Prevented Text Stretching
**Added to text elements**:
```javascript
style={{
  // ... existing styles
  // Prevent text from stretching too wide
  maxWidth: '100%',
  wordWrap: 'break-word'
}}
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed minHeight**: Replaced with maxHeight to prevent stretching
2. **Enhanced object-fit**: Ensured both videos and images maintain proper aspect ratio
3. **Text wrapping**: Added word-wrap to prevent text from stretching across very wide cards
4. **Consistent sizing**: Maintained the original layout dimensions while preventing stretching

## Result
- ✅ First two cards no longer appear stretched
- ✅ Media maintains proper aspect ratio
- ✅ Text wraps properly on wide cards
- ✅ Layout maintains original design
- ✅ Video functionality preserved

## Files Modified
- `Website-frontend/components/VideoAwarePostCard.jsx` - Fixed stretching issues

## Testing
The fix should be visible immediately:
- First two cards should appear with proper proportions
- Media should not be stretched or distorted
- Text should wrap naturally within the card boundaries
- Overall layout should maintain the original design
