# Layout Fix Summary

## Issue
The layout was broken after implementing VideoAwarePostCard - only videos were showing and the card structure was disrupted.

## Root Cause
The VideoAwarePostCard component was using a different layout structure than the original PostCard component. The original PostCard uses:
- Background image approach with absolute positioning
- Three-section layout (category button, main content, metadata)
- Specific z-index layering

## Solution
Updated VideoAwarePostCard to match the original PostCard structure exactly:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Background Media Approach**
   - Changed from complex nested divs to background media with absolute positioning
   - Videos and images now work as background media (z-index: -1)
   - Added gradient overlay for text readability

2. **Layout Structure**
   - Top section: Category button
   - Middle section: Title and excerpt
   - Bottom section: Metadata (read time, category, date)

3. **Link Integration**
   - Added proper Link wrapper around entire card
   - Maintains clickability for navigation

4. **Video Integration**
   - Videos work as background media just like images
   - Hover play/pause functionality preserved
   - Graceful fallback to images when videos fail

## Result
- ✅ Layout restored to original appearance
- ✅ Videos display properly as background media
- ✅ All text and metadata visible
- ✅ Hover effects working
- ✅ Clickable cards for navigation
- ✅ Consistent with original PostCard design

## Files Modified
- `Website-frontend/components/VideoAwarePostCard.jsx` - Fixed layout structure
